# Conversational Transformer Models Collection

This repository contains a collection of Conversational Transformer models.
It uses tensorflow and stanford's convokit for data fetching and
preprocessing.


## Installation

- On a python 3.7+ virtual environment:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```


## Training and Running

After installing the package, you can run the training with the commands:

```python -m src.biconditional.train```  
```python -m src.vanilla.train```


## Interacting with the models

After training, you can interact with the models on a interactive
question-answer session with the commands:

```python -m src.biconditional.interact```  
```python -m src.vanilla.interact```
